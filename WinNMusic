While working at WInNMusic (March 2023 â€“ present), I led the community of the VKontakte music project, increasing the number of its participants and engagement.

Tasks
Im responded to user requests on a daily basis, solving problems related to the processing and purchase of services, explaining the strengths of each service. 
Im published weekly training posts on the basics of NFT, increasing users' understanding.

Example of interaction
The user's query: "Which service should I choose to increase listening at different venues?"
is my answer.:
Hi! In order for you to choose the right service, you need to understand what kind of result you want to get and on which platforms. We recommend choosing the Ultra tariff, as this will allow you to listen on VK and Yandex Music platforms. Tell me your budget and we will discuss which service is better to choose!  

Influence:
In 3 months, the VK community has grown by 20% (from 5,000 to 5,750 members), and engagement has increased by 20% thanks to active support and content.
