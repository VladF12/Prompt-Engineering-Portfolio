Generating a Marketing Banner with Sora GPT for Canva
Overview
During my time at Canva (June 2022 â€“ December 2023), I created a marketing banner using Sora GPT to promote a new feature in the platform. The goal was to create an eye-catching design for social media ads.

Prompt for Sora GPT
Generate a marketing banner for Canva promoting the "Magic Design" feature. The design should be vibrant, featuring a laptop with colorful design elements (e.g., shapes, sparkles) coming out of the screen. Use a color palette of yellow, teal, and magenta. Include the text "Unleash Your Creativity with Magic Design!" in a playful font (e.g., Poppins) at the center. The dimensions should be 1600x400px with a transparent background.

Example Result
The generated banner showed a sleek laptop with yellow, teal, and magenta shapes and sparkles bursting from the screen, symbolizing creativity. The text "Unleash Your Creativity with Magic Design!" in Poppins font was centered, creating a vibrant ad for Canva.Imaginary Link: imgur.com/canva_magic_design_banner.png
