Overview

While working with web3 clients at Hootsuite (March 2021 â€“ May 2022), I used Sora GPT to create a cover image for an NFT collection. The goal was to attract collectors with a futuristic design.



Prompt for Sora GPT

Generate a cover image for an NFT collection called "Cyber Beasts." The design should be futuristic, featuring a neon-lit cybernetic animal (e.g., a wolf) in a digital cityscape. Use a color palette of neon blue, purple, and pink. Include the text "Cyber Beasts" in a bold, sci-fi font (e.g., Exo) at the top. The dimensions should be 1200x1200px with a transparent background.



Example Result

The generated image featured a neon-blue cybernetic wolf standing on a skyscraper in a digital cityscape, with purple and pink lights reflecting off its surface. The text "Cyber Beasts" in Exo font glowed at the top, creating a striking visual for the NFT collection.


Impact:
This cover increased interest in the NFT collection, attracting 5,000 unique visitors to the launch page.
