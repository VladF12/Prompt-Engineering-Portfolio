Generating Personalized Email Campaigns with Grok

Overview
During my work at Anthropic (January 2024 â€“ April 2025), I developed prompts for Grok to automate personalized email campaigns for a SaaS product. The goal was to increase open rates and conversions by tailoring emails to user preferences.
